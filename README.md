# snap collector plugin - SMART

This plugin monitors storage systems from Intel's SSDs. Raw data interpretation is based on [State Drive DC S3700 Series specification](http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-specifications/ssd-dc-s3700-spec.pdf). 
Other disks may have different attributes or different raw data formats.
